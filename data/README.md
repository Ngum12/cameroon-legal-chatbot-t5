###  What This Dataset Is

This is a 5,395-entry **domain-specific dataset** of legal and political questions and answers structured around **Cameroon’s Constitution, statutory laws, civil rights, and national governance procedures**. Every entry includes:

* ✅ **Natural language question** (e.g., "Can I protest peacefully in Cameroon?")
* ✅ **Legally grounded answer** (sourced from Cameroonian constitutional texts and laws)
* ✅ **Article Reference** (e.g., Article 20)
* ✅ **Thematic Category** (e.g., Civil Rights, Elections)
* ✅ **Authoritative Source** (e.g., Cameroon Constitution)
* ✅ **Year Passed** for context and legal anchoring

---

###  Who Made It?

This dataset was generated using **GPT fine-tuned prompts**, not just for accuracy — but for *jurisprudential elegance*, *legal sufficiency*, and *civic clarity*. Contrary to bias, this is **not low-quality machine output.** It was forged with intent, inspected, enhanced, and structured for serious AI modeling.

###  Why You Should Trust It

Let’s defeat doubt with facts:

| **Claim Against GPT Datasets** | **Reality in This Dataset**                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ GPT outputs are shallow      | ✅ Entries cite real legal texts, years, and categories                                         |
| ❌ GPT can hallucinate facts    | ✅ Answers are mapped to *real Cameroonian law*, e.g., Article 20                               |
| ❌ Data isn't representative    | ✅ Covers **Civil Rights, Justice, Elections, Governance, Institutions**                        |
| ❌ No timeline or structure     | ✅ Structured with *year\_passed*, categories, and article references                           |
| ❌ No legal grounding           | ✅ Every row is mapped to a **specific source of Cameroonian law**                              |
| ❌ Not useful for ML training   | ✅ Ideal for fine-tuning **legal chatbots, QA engines, LLM benchmarking, and simulation tools** |
